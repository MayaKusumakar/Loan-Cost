# Loan-Cost
## Problem
Loans can be expensive and it is important to figure out how to budget for them. To this you need to know

  - How much money you will be paying each month
  - How much the loan will cost you

Your program should ask the user for the following information in this order: 

1. The amount they are borrowing
2. The annual (yearly) interest rate
3. The number of months the payments are to be made over

After collecting the above information the program reports the monthly payment as well as the total cost of the loan.

## Requirements
  - Your Program must compile with the -Wall, -Werror, and -Wextra options enabled
  - Use doubles and not floats for all numbers that could have a decimal point in them
  - Print all double to 2 decimal places
  - 
## Assumptions
  - All input is valid
  - Assume that payments are made monthly (the norm) so you will need to divide the annual interest rate by 12 to get the monthly interest rate to use in your calculations.

# Examples

## Example 1
Please enter the amount of money you borrowed: $1000

Please enter the annual interest rate: .05

Please enter the number of payments to be made: 12

A loan of $1000.00 with an annual interest of 0.05 paid off over 12 months will have monthly payments of $85.61.

In total, you will pay $1027.29, making the cost of your loan $27.29.

## Example 2
Please enter the amount of money you borrowed: $60000

Please enter the annual interest rate: .07

Please enter the number of payments to be made: 120

A loan of $60000.00 with an annual interest of 0.07 paid off over 120 months will have monthly payments of $696.65.

In total, you will pay $83598.11, making the cost of your loan $23598.11.
